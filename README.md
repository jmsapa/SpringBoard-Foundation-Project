Capstone Idea: 

To examine the box office totals for different movie genres using the same movie director and movie star. I will collect and examine data from the filmography for both subjects and use genre box office totals from all movies from 2001 until 2015 and will use said data to predict box office totals for each genre if my two subjects were to make that specific kind of motion picture. I will use data from imdb box office mojo and any other reputible site that has box office totals.
